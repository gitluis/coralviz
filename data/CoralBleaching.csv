incredible visibility (100ft.+) and its fairly consistant
conditions suitable for coral growth.  Over the past 2-4
months in particular, we have had water temperatures of 86-89 F
at depths of 80-100ft.  I found this a bit surprising and it
seems to me that there has been quite a bit more bleaching
occuring lately.  Other areas in Micronesia - Palau in
particular, have had devasting bleaching problems.""",http://orbit-net.nesdis.noaa.gov/orad/sub/bleaching_reports - Lisa Skilang,0,NMI

The corals showing the next greatest effect are the bushy species such as Pocillopora, Stylophora and Seriatopora.(Hoegh-Guldberg, O. et al.)

Coral bleaching was observed with about 7% of corals bleached.
Observed maximum water temperture was 28.2 deg C.
Bleaching was most extensive at intermediate depths of the upper
slope, at 3-6m, compared to shallower upper slope and reef flat.
Acropora cervicorn was most severely affected, followed by
A. nobilis, A. formosa, A. yongei, A. abrolhosensis.
Partial bleaching of corals was observed in the intertidal lagoon.
A. palifera, A. millepora, and several montiporiids were affected.
Bleaching of other corals was rare.
Extensive turbidity was observed during the bleaching event which
was not observed at near-by One tree Island where bleaching was
minimal.  Algal blooms were extensive in patches of staghorn acroporids 0.5-2m depth at upper slope. These were severely bleached in 1998.
Bleaching was in 'recovery' phase, i.e. Bleached colonies were
recovering their color, measured photosynthetic yeilds were
reduced compared to unbleached corals, but were not as low as in
bleached corals (Fv/Fm 0.4-0.65). (A. Salih, 26/2/2002).

The amount of bleaching has increased during the past few weeks
- perhaps due to the ""maturing"" of previous damage and/or added
insult from low tides in the middle of the day.  The final analysis
indicates something like 60-70% of corals in the intertidal being
completely bleached with mortality running at around 20%.  Off the

However, after high wind intensities and coastal upwelling caused further sea surface temperature reductions during autumn 1998, we observed widespread bleaching in the reef tract, but mortality only occurred in the two most northern reefs of the area: Tijera and Mazunte. Pocillopora was the most affected genus, although Pavona and Porites were impacted, too. In normal years, northern winds cross the Gulf of Mï¿½xico and increase their speed when passing through the Tehuantepec Isthmus. They displace surface water and produce strong upwellings that affect an area of about 200X500 km in the Gulf of Tehuantepec.","Reyes-Bonilla, et al 2002.

Bleaching is mild to moderate rather than severe; colonies are ï¿½palingï¿½, and all shades of colour from normal to white are observed. In Kenya, most paling and bleaching is on upper surfaces, and the coincidence of high temperatures, calm conditions and spring low tides just prior to bleaching suggest combined effects of these factors rather than an overwhelming dominance of one.

By 21 Aug 1996 mean SST in Kaneohe Bay reached 28.5 C and was increasing rapidly. Wind speed dropped to a low level.  Solar radiation input was at near annual maximum with little cloud cover. Corals throughout the inner portion of Kaneohe Bay began to show signs of stress including contracted polyps, mucous secretion and some discoloration. Maximum mid-day temperature on the reef began to exceed 30 C starting on 26 Aug
1996. By 31 August 1996 the daily mean SST exceeded 30 C with a daily mid day maximum approaching 30.7 C.  By this time the bleaching process was conspicuously underway in corals throughout the inner portion of the bay.  Corals in the lagoon area directly in front of the main building of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology experienced higher temperatures due to restricted circulation and were highly bleached by 26 August 1996. Large tracts of corals throughout the inshore portion of Kaneohe Bay became highly bleached by 4 September. The areas where significant amounts of bleaching occurred were confined to the inner portion of Kaneohe Bay. The proportion of coral heads that bleached throughout the affected area varied from less than 5% in some areas to 100% over large sections of reef.  The amount of bleaching diminished near stream discharge points or other areas where turbidity was high.  Bleaching decreased with depth, especially in localized areas of high turbidity.
The period of highest thermal stress occurred between 14 August and 5 September (22 days).  During this time period the mean daily temperature remained in the 29-30 C  range.  The corals became progressively more bleached throughout September even  though temperature was declining.  Maximum bleaching occurred from 2 to 4 weeks  after the peak of highest temperature.  A second less severe warming episode  developed in early October, but peak temperature remained below 29 C and did  not appear to further increase the rate of bleaching.  By mid October  temperatures diminished into the normal range and recovery of bleached  corals was underway.  Corals that were only slightly bleached started to regain pigmentation.  The remaining zooxanthellae in the lower shaded portions of bleached colonies began to rapidly re-infect the upper surface bleached areas.  Corals that were highly bleached died or regained pigment very slowly.
Most of the colonies throughout the bay had recovered by mid November.  Some of the highly bleached colonies  still were white in color in late November, but regained full pigment by the end of December 1996.","Jokiel, P.L. personal communication to  NOAA & ReefBase (18/7/2003)",,USA_HAW

Coral bleaching occurred at Lee Stocking Island following a short period (18 days) of daily average water temperatures above 30 .5`C on the bank in July-August 1990 followed by another temperature peak in mid-September. A maximum temperature of 32.5C was reached on 23 September 1990 . The July monthly average for 1990 did not differ from surrounding years, but August and September were significantly wanner in 1990.

than 5% bleaching recorded in areas that were up to 90% bleached in 1998. It appears that
recovery of healthy corals at deeper sites was significant. For example at convention 18m,
the recovery was from <10% live tissue growth from over 45% living cover, to over 25%
tissue with zooxanthellae. This represents an increase in coral tissue with
zooxanthellae of over 150% six months after the bleaching was recorded.
At Hilarys Reef, the coral at 18m was left with <10% cover with zooxanthellae after
the bleaching event in August, but recovered to over 20% (another 100%+ recovery rate) in
6 months. Pavona clavus tissue at Hilarys Reef showed considerable recovery of
zooxanthellae, with many of the colonies becoming pigmented at medium (12m) depths six
months after August. Here, healthy corals significantly changed from a
cover of less than 5% in September 1998 to over 60% by August 2000. This 55% increase in
healthy coral tissue was related to existing P. clavus colonies regaining their zooxanthellae..
What was encouraging was the recovery of live coral one year after the bleaching
event. At Hilarys Reef 18m (5 to 23%), Convention 12m (5 to 18%), Convention
18m (3 to 30%) there were all rises in the population of healthy (pigmented) coral tissue.
These changes were not statistically significant, but were important trends at deeper depths
that showed positive change in coral percent cover for these areas. Bleached coral
populations fell considerably over the first year of observations.
At Convention reef, diverse coral forms such as Porites cylindrica, Sarcophyton spp.
and bottlebrush Acropora spp. were all damaged, with at least over 50% of their tissue
bleached. The branching coral Pocillopora damicornis was observed in three
quadrats in two different locations, and appeared not to have beached as readily as other
Acropora sp. branching and digitate life-forms.","1 m2 quadrat, with photographics and insitu observation",,31C,,"Bleaching occurred over  August and September 1998. Corals were affected to a depth of 18m. Percentage of bleached corals was seen to range from 35 to 90% between 0 and 25m depth around the whole island. The reduction in percent corals bleached at all depths over the first year of observation was dramatic (live coral cover fell from a maximum of 80% for all depths to between 0 and 10% in 1999). Around Danjugan, these areas were dominated by colonies of branching Acropora spp. and Seriatopora hystrix.
Initially, an average of around 80% of corals from all depths were bleached at Hilarys Reef. Corals that bleached were dominated by P. clavus in the shallow depths of Hilarys Reef. In deeper depths, more delicate plating forms such as were seen to bleach, but not as severely as the P. clavus from the 6m quadrats.Bleaching over the shallower areas was also recorded in soft coral forms (Sinularia flexibilis, other Sinularia spp. and Sarcophyton spp.).

About 1/4 to 3/4 of living staghorns are at least partially bleached in 3 lagoons on Tutuila.  Only upper surfaces of horizontal branches have any bleaching (usually it is only partial even on upper surfaces); undersides always retain some color.  No colonies are totally bleached, none recently dead.  A few A. palifera and A. cf. listeri are bleached, but there are very few colonies of these species in the lagoons.  Other species are not bleached.  Bleaching was first seen on March 20.  The last previous check of these corals was on Feb 28.
     Temperature loggers in one lagoon show temperatures rising to a peak averaging a little over 30C in mid-February, and remaining fairly steady since then.  Peak temperatures reach 32C for a few hours on some days.  These 3 lagoons have little water circulating into them at low tide.  25-75% of staghorns in the more closed lagoons are bleached.  Similar areas with the same staghorns that have open circulation with the ocean have very little bleaching (about 1-5%).  Reef fronts that have been looked at also have no bleaching, but do not have these staghorns.
    I am told that last year there was strong bleaching of the staghorns, and there was bleaching in the previous summer as well.

Records from temperature loggers show that the sea surface temperature in American Samoa was heating up in December and early January.  When Hurricane Heta hit on Jan 6, 2004 it caused a sudden large drop in sea surface temperatures, most likely due to wave mixing of surface waters with cooler deeper water.  After Jan 6, sea surface temperature began to warm again, starting at a new lower base.  So in effect, Hurricane Heta reset the summer warming of surface waters.  Presumably then the maximum temperatures that were reached were lower than they would have been otherwise, and bleaching was more mild than it would have been otherwise.  Normal summer bleaching here may be closer to that experienced in the previous two summers, when mass bleaching of perhaps 20-30% of corals on reef slopes was followed by the death of some table corals on slopes and some staghorns and fire coral in lagoons.",Doug Fenner [dfenner@blueskynet.as] in Coral-list@coral.aoml.noaa.gov 30/3/2004 and personal communication to ReefBase.,,ASM

In this location there are many table corals (Acropora cytherea) that have come up after the 1998 coral bleaching event, which destroyed almost all corals in these shallow coral patches. No signs of bleaching were observed on Acropora cytherea. 2 small colonies of Acropora muricata about 25 cm high were completely bleached. Bleached massive coral colonies were relatively small (about 30 cm across or less). Partial bleaching was observed on massive corals. <br>
In the latter half of March 2005 the temperature on land was relatively high with humidity 90% or higher. The sea surface temperature was not measured where the bleaching was observed. <br>
Since 31st of March 2005 the weather on the west coast has changed to pre-monsoon. This means that there is SW winds and rain. If the rainy weather continues it might save the corals from further bleaching.

Almost all corals were totally white to pale yellow. Some massive star coral colonies (Montastraea annularis and M. faveolata) still had slightly colored basal patches.

Siderastrea siderea was less affected with a dark bluish-violet color in several colonies, and a few normally brown. S. radians was apparently not affected (hard to tell, the small encrustations of this species being normally so light). Even Favia fragum golfball corals were fully bleached. Benthic, rubble-dwelling anemones (probably corallymorpharians) were white. Millepora spp. had both white, normal and ""pinto"" (patchy) like colonies-branches. Did not see any Acropora to tell whether the few remaining colonies bleached or not.<br>

It seemed that deeper corals were less bleached. However, Jaime Rojas, biologist working for both the National Park authorities and the Oceanarium, undertook on July 8 a quick survey around the islands confirming that the phenomenon is widespread. He is making a follow up, and working with daily sea-surface temperature data (possibly salinity too) taken regularly at the Oceanarium. Later on he may make a more detailed report. <br>

4319,Pacific,Micronesia,American Samoa,"Nuuuli pool, Tutuila",-14.28,-170.715,10,2005,,1,Low,,Acropora formosa,over 95%,,,,,,,,,,"Staghorn corals (Acropora formosa = A. muricata) have begun bleaching in the fringing reef pools of Tutuila, American Samoa.  As of 10/29/05, over 95% of A. formosa in Nuuuli pool, Tutuila, American Samoa are partly bleached.  Mike King reports similar bleaching in Alofau pool, Tutuila.  They recovered from the previous summer's bleaching just 5 months ago.<br>
Some have suggested that due to rising temperatures from global warming, in the future coral reefs may bleach every summer.  This is already happening in the pools of American Samoa.  Because it is a regular, annual event, and there are several possible controls, this offers an opportunity for scientists to plan studies of bleaching instead of having to take advantage of unpredictable opportunities.<br>
For the past two Austral summers, I have recorded the bleaching of three species of staghorn Acropora  (A. formosa, A. pulchra, and A. nobilis) in the fringing reef pools of Tutuila, American Samoa.  Acopora formosa and Porites cylindrica dominate the pools of Tutuila, but P. cylindrica was not observed to bleach.  Bleaching of the three staghorns has reached as high as 100 percent of the colonies in some of the pools, with colonies nearly entirely white.  At the same time, very few corals on the outer reef slopes were observed bleaching.  Acropora nobilis is present on the outer slopes (though not common), and did not bleach there when the same species strongly bleached in the pools.  The pools reach higher temperatures than on the outer slopes.  Most of the pools had peak temperatures of 32-33 oC in the last summer, but one hit a peak of 34.9 oC (for a half hour).  The highest temperatures occur on sunny summer days when low tide is midday, reducing circulation.  High temperatures are well known in the pools of nearby Ofu island, American Samoa (Craig, Birkeland, and Belliveau, 2001).  Those pools have a higher diversity of corals and less bleaching.<br>
Mass coral bleaching on outer reef slopes was observed by several people in American Samoa in 2002 and 2003, though the time and intensity were not recorded.  At present, about half of all staghorn colonies in the pools are dead.  Essentially none have died in the past two years, so it is likely they died in 2002 and/or 2003, when bleaching was more intense.  Thus, along with the present bleaching, staghorns in the pools have bleached for five years in a row. <br>
In 2004, staghorns in the pools began to bleach in March, peaked in April, and ended in August.  Bleaching started again in November (04), peaked in the January to April (05) period, and ended at the end of May (05).  Now bleaching has started again at the end of October (05).  Pool staghorns are spending more of the year bleached than recovered, year after year.","Douglas Fenner, Dept. of Marine & Wildlife Resources, American Samoa (Douglas Fenner [dfenner@blueskynet.as] in Coral list 11/8/2005",,ASM

Report on 11/5/2005 <br>
During monitoring in response to the bleaching event within the US Virgin
Islands, we've noticed a dramatic increase in the coloration (trend to
normal color) of corals within our study reefs around St. John.  This has
happened within the past 10 - 14 days.  Most corals have at least some
light color (as opposed to white), and some have gradients from pale to
full normal color.  No single species seems to be changing color more
rapidly than any other. Depths of our monitoring sites are between 15-60
ft (4.6-8.3 m).<br>

The mean seawater temperature (55 ft/16.8 m) at a monitoring site at
Tektite Reef went from 30.4ï¿½ C (86.7ï¿½ F) in September to 29.6ï¿½ C (85.3ï¿½ F)
in October.<br>

October was a very rainy and cloudy month.  During the period 9/30 -
10/11, 11.04 inches (28 cm) of rain were recorded while the seawater
temperature at a monitoring site (depth 55 ft/16.8 m) dropped 1.6 ï¿½C (~3
ï¿½F). <br>

Colpophyllia natans colonies were pale. By the 11th of November the
bleaching event became more evident: nearly all colonies of M. annularis

It is interesting to note that corals at the TNNP bleached quite late
compared to other reef corals throughout the Caribbean [e.g. reefs at
Islas del Rosario, only 200 k southwest from the TNNP, bleached 4 months
earlier in late June (report by Sven Zea posted in coral list)]. This
might have some relation to the bi-modal seasonal upwelling that occurs in
the area, with upwelling peaks taking place early in the year and by
July-August. <br>

Dï¿½az et al. for Santa Marta, Colombia (fecha). In this case, however, we have not identified a mechanism such as upwelling, that helps to explain this delay between maximum temperature and bleaching. <br>

Between the 23rd of September and the 4th of October of 2005, during the annual surveys of the GCRMN and CARICOMP, we examined five reefs, two oceanics, at Los Roques Archipelago National Park and three continental reefs at MNP. We surveyed more than 500 colonies between 5 and 12 m depth, and only two colonies were partially bleached (< 5% of their surface).  Sea surface temperature (SST) was
30 ï¿½C. <br>

Of the bleached colonies, 19% were afected in < 10% of their surface, 5% were afected in 10-25% of their surface, 19% in 25-50% of their surface and 60% of the colonies were bleached in 75-100% of their surface. We also observed bleached.colonies of  D. strigosa, M. cavernosa, P. astreoides, C. natans, D. laberyntiformis outside those transects.<br>

By the 13th of November, the SST had dropped to 28.7 ï¿½C but qualitatively we observed more colonies bleached than the previous two weeks and it seemed more intense in terms of colony whiteness.  Thus, in Cayo Sombrero bleaching did not occur at the maximum SST in july-september, but a month later. <br>

Limited bleaching of Montastrea annularis was also observed; however, many coral heads of this species displayed significant blanching. Water quality testing showed physical and chemical parameters were within normal levels at the time.

The Bahamian Reef Survey has collected data since 1992, on the shallow patch reefs surrounding the Island. This bleaching event is the third bleaching event documented on San Salvador in that time period. Initially the data suggest that the bleaching event is similar to a 1995/96 bleaching event in both scope and affected species.

In general, the coral bleaching event was widespread and occurred all around Buck Island but with no obvious spatial patterns. Also, no spatial patterns were observed in the occurrence of bleaching for four abundant coral species. A weak but significant correlation (r 2 = 0.159, P = 0.0023) occurred between overall bleaching and depth, such that corals at shallower sites had higher rates of bleaching than those at deeper sites. If coral bleaching is temperature related, the observed correlation between depth and bleaching suggests that water temperature at depth would be lower than at the surface. However, water temperature, measured with a dive computer (Oceanic ProPlus 2) was not significantly lower at deeper sites than at shallower sites (r 2 = 0.004, P = 0.633, F = 0.230, df = 60).

Limited surveys revealed significant mechanical impacts at all three sites within the Sanctuary, including large boulders of reef rock and coral (up to 4m x2m in size) removed and tossed around the reef and into the sand flats, and at up to 1m of sand removed from the sand flats.  Large barrel sponges (Xestospongia muta) have suffered considerable damage, including partial and full removal, or filling up with sand. Coral tissue, sediment, and water samples were collected for contaminant analysis through a collaboration between the FGBNMS, NCCOS, and the University of Hawaii.  These collections were made in response to a large body of polluted water that made its way out from the TX/LA coast to the FGBNMS after Hurricane Rita (see http://coastwatch.noaa.gov/tsm/search.html).","The Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary research team conducted a post-hurricane cruise to the Sanctuary last week.   <br>

Croy will be conducting quantitative surveys and tagging colonies in the next days.

On the other hand, here in Puerto Rico, there are no signs of a bleaching event. Just the usual, a few pale colonies here and there. Same situation observed during our disease surveys last week in Grenada.","Observer: Croy McCoy

anularis, Millipora, octocorals",,,,,,,,,,,"As a follow up to my pervious post on ""Coral bleaching and an unknown sponge disease in Tobago"", I returned to a monitoring site, surveyed only 10 dys earlier, and I to my dismay, within the 20-40ft depth area there is mass mortality of the Giant Barrel Sponges (Xestospongia muta).  Some of the other songes are also looking a bit poorly, but not to the extent of mortality.  Samples have been retrieved for analysis both heathy and unhealthy looking X. muta.  That said, even heathy looking sponges were snapping off at their bases.  There is also wide spread bleaching, especially at the 23-35ft depth at Speyside, affecting most species(Montastrea faviolata, Siderastrea sidera, S. radians, all Diplorias, M.
Anularis, Millipora, octocorals etc). Speyside's reefs are generally sponge
dominated, but the main reef building coral species are Montastrea
faveolata, Siderastrea sidera, Diploria spp. And Madracis mirabilis.  At
deeper depths, up to 60ft moderate bleaching was observed, and only of
particular species (Meandrina meandrities and Siderastrea sidera).  The
water temperature at this depth was quite warm, with temperature loggers
recording on the reefs at 30ft showing temperatures up to 31 deg C.
 Interestingly some resiliency studies/models indicate that the longer lived
and slower growing species, such as boulder corals (Montastreas and
Siderastrea) are more resilient that branching species (Porities and
Madracis), however very very little bleaching of M. mirabilis was observed.
 M. mirabilis can be found in extensive spreads in Speyside with octocorals,
sponges, boulder and brain corals inter-dispersed.

Thus far the north eastern side of the island is the only location I've been
able to follow up on, but I have received reports of increased bleaching
along the Caribbean coast and south west of the island.

significant coral bleaching around the Cambodian islands of Koh Rong and Koh Rong Samloem. The extent of this bleaching has been severe with many reef sites showing bleaching levels of 90 to 100% across all coral species. These sites were all shallow-water reefs no deeper than 12 meters. The bleaching began in mid-April and reached its peak about 3-4 weeks ago when the water temperatures increased by at least 2??C, bringing surface water temperatures up to 34??C and over. The  start  of  the  rainy  season  last week has brought cooler water temperatures but has also resulted in heavy sedimentation levels, smothering and  killing  off  many of the bleached colonies. Acropora spp. And D. Heliopora colonies have been hit particularly hard but there are some large Porites colonies which seem to be coping with the unusual conditions. With water temperatures dropping back to 31??C, we are hoping to see some colour returning to Cambodia???s reefs! If you would like further information and images of the bleaching event, feel  free to get in touch with me directly or contact Vicki Bush, the Project Scientist in Cambodia at [1]cambodia at coralcay.org.

But it recovered year by year, at this year, the live hard coral percentage come back to 70%. This recovery of hard coral percentage means hard coral in this area grow up well and the environment for hard coral keeps good. And other reason, main stream of the Kuroshio current, major warm current in western Pacific ocean, stays near shore of Kii peninsula in a last few years, so the seawater temperature in winter keeps not so cold. This 70% of live hard coral percentage is very good to compare to Okinawa area, the hard coral in Okinawa got major damage in a few years. We found many Drupella spp. in last survey, but this year, we cound not found them at the transect and near it, so we think an influence of these shell is not so high now. However, we have to note shell damage in the future.
We found many tropical fishes like a kind of Pomacentridae species, they are not original indicator in RC but we choose some of them for additional indicator, we think one of the reason is the warm current stay near the shore. We found no major change in invertebrate survey.""
We think the hard coral in this area will become good to 2004 level in next year if it will be not so cold, no typhoon and no eaten trace by shells or COTS, because the tabler type hard coral recover well. But we need to remember many coral died in 2004-2005 winter and it necessary for 4 years to recover it. This large tabler type hard coral colony is one of the most northern colony of the world (or Japan),  the periodic survey like RC in this area is very meaningful.",Reef check submitted by Megumu Tsuchikawa.

In this Yaeyama area, coral reef got huge damage by bleaching, typhoon and crown of thorns, from summer of 2007 till winter.

Suspect much of the rubble is from the shallower depths where bomb damage is severe, mostly fragments of branching corals, dominated by Acropora, amount of rubble is far more than could be provided by the amount of live branching forms. Some dead coral not obvious poison or disease, but sosial survey indicates high level of cyanide use, and no coloured dividing line so concluded damage was cyadine rather than disease.

Many of the RKC and HC are mushroom corals, which seem to have increased in number at this depth compared to previous monitoring. The sand is mainly borderline sand/silt, but sand component larger, unlike the 3m where the silt component is dominant. Sponge includes many branching tubular sponges which have increased, as well as massive sponges. Soft coral has decreased. Most COTs off-transect/belt were near segments 3 and 4, seems that segments 1 and 2 have been pretty much totallt predated causing a shift in the COTs population to areas with remaining HC cover. Many COTs outside transect also, including a group of 15 individuals around 1 massive coral about 30cm diameter. COTs attack main cause of coral death and subsequent breaking to rubble. No trash unlike previous visit, maybe because seaweed farming has moved slightly and because fishing is now rare at this site, due to poor returns. No non-COTs bleaching and no disease visible.","Reef Check, Submitted by Abigail Moore.  Site ID  119.51.21.1E.0.44.51.8S",,IDN

Coral patches cover an area of 3876.2 m2. In 2003 a small jetty was constructed between the sea and the Juluapan lagoon adjacent to the north-west margin of the reef.
This zone is constantly exposed to increases of temperature influenced by the diurnal contributions from the Juluapan Lagoon, from which influxes of water at 27,5 and 32.0 ï¿½C in winter and summer, respectively.
During the summer of 2004 (Aprilï¿½June) diving campaigns were undertaken to study the bleaching phenomenon in this zone.  Bleaching evaluations of Pocillopora capitata were conducted by assessing  the concentrations of chlorophyll a and total carotenoids from samples along submarine transect lines.
The coralline population at La Boquita is under a state of local thermal stress, which is a direct consequence of the inappropriate location of the artificial intercommunication structure of the Juluapan Lagoon, which could cause irreversible damage to the reef's productivity, adaptability and regeneration capacity.","Ms Angelica Flores Ramirez,  Universidad de Colima.",,MEX

Results of the monitoring determined the majority Agaricia agaricites colonies were showing signs of bleaching - with many colonies exhibiting bleaching of greater than 75 percent. Also, as part of a reef restoration experiment, many Acropora palmata transplants suffered mortality since the project's last monitoring effort in July.  Prior to July, most of the transplants had survived over one year and had exhibited new tissue growth. Review of temperature logger data showed water temperatures >30C  in August. Finally, and somewhat curiously, much less algae was observed on the reefs than in previous monitoring efforts and large corals (e.g., Diploria sp., Montastrea sp., etc.) exhibited little, if any, ill effects.

Anecdotal reports from residents on the island indicated that air temperatures in August were the hottest that anyone could remember.
