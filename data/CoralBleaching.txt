ReefBase Dataset: CORAL BLEACHING

DATASET DESCRIPTION:
The ReefBase Coral Bleaching dataset provides observation details of coral bleaching
occurrences (or lack thereof) around the world. This dataset was build upon an original
bleaching database developed at UNEP-WCMC, and has been maintained and updated
regularly by ReefBase since early 2002. Main sources of information for this dataset
have been: published records from the literature, postings on the coral-list
(http://www.coral.noaa.gov/lists/), the ReefBase online Bleaching Report
(http://www.reefbase.org/contribute/bleachingreport.aspx), and through collaborations
with numerous institutions and individuals. ReefBase would like to particularly acknowledge
the contributions made by: National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), and Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA).
YOU CAN HELP US MAINTAIN THE CORAL BLEACHING DATABASE, BY USING OUR ONLINE
BLEACHING REPORT FOR ANY OBSERVATIONS YOU MAY HAVE (http://www.reefbase.org/contribute/bleachingreport.aspx).
