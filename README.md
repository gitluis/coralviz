## Abstract
The idea is to obtain a coral dataset containing coral information such as location, coral bleaching, or coral diseases with enough different corals and/or metrics to generate multiple visualizations of the data set for further analysis. A dashboard containing different graphs showing the information in different forms which could even lead to detecting any similarities in between the coral samples.

## Datasets
Coral datasets available inside the `data` directory. Coral data sets descriptions can also be found in text format inside the `data` directory.

## Coral Bleaching & Diseases
Coral Bleaching is the process by which coral losses its own major source of food which is algae surrounding it (Figure 1). When algae leave the coral, it becomes vulnerable to diseases. This can be caused by many factors such as changes in ocean temperature, ocean pollution, overexposure to sunlight, extreme low tides, overall climate changes (CO2), ocean acidification (pH level changes), climate precipitation, altered ocean currents, storms, sea level rise, global warming and among many other (Figure 2).
In addition, coral can be affected by diseases caused by infections from bacteria, viruses or stressors as previously mentioned in Figure 2 which slowly kill the coral by consuming the living tissue or leaving large patches of living coral tissue to slough off exposing coralâ€™s skeleton. Some of these diseases are Black-band disease, Dark-spot disease, Patchy necrosis (white pox), White plague, White-band disease, Yellow-band disease, Algae disease, Fungal disease and many others. See Figure 3 to Figure 11 in [Appendix](https://github.com/gitluis/coralviz#appendix) for a visual picture of coral diseases.
