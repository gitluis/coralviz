## Abstract
The idea is to obtain a coral dataset containing coral information such as location, coral bleaching, or coral diseases with enough different corals and/or metrics to generate multiple visualizations of the data set for further analysis. A dashboard containing different graphs showing the information in different forms which could even lead to detecting any similarities in between the coral samples.

## Datasets
